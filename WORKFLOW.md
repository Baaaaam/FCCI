Each different part of the FCCI should be based on a specific problem or
question that we want to answer.
For each problem a cycle will be defined as well as a set of interesting output
metrics input variable and modeling option.


The goal of the full problem will be to determine the sensitivity of the output
metrics to the input parameter, the modelisation option and/or to the different
hypothesis relative to the fuel cycle simulation.


To do so, one need to build a set of question/problems with an increasing
complexity. 
The first set will consist to the definition of simple set of elementary block
that are consistent together, which all put together will consistitute the full
cycle one aims to consider.
For each elementary blocks using a fix set a input parameters, modeling options
and hypothesis, a values of the ouput metrics will be provided. A first
comparison between the different tools and simulation parameters will allows to
understand the difference between the different tools/simulations, and ensure
that each tool and simualtion are working as expected.

The second part of the workflow will be dedicated to perfom on a limited number
of test cases the full cycle simulation. This will allow to run a first round of
comparison between tools and simulation option.


The last part of each problem, will consistant for each tool to run a sentisity
analysis to all the different simulation hypothesis parameters. Running a large
number of simulation shuffling input parameters, modeling options to be used to
run sensitivity analysis.
