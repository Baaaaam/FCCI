## Scenario

A scenario is constituted by the following set :

	- Input
	- Model
	- Output

It defines a well defined trajectory for a nuclear fleet evolution on a given time frame.

## Input

Self consistant set of input parameters that allows the complete description of the simulated scenario.

## Input Parameter

Data used to build input for scenario that should be chosen by the user. Input parameter is used to define : 

	- Time frame
	- Cycle units (facilities and connections)
	- Facilities parameters (BU, cooling time, tail assets, power, etc.)
	- Facilities evolution
	- Model hypothesis

## Model

Represents the computationnal tool that processes the input and performing output calculation according to defined hypothesis. Here's a non exhaustive list of models : 

	- CYCLUS
	- CLASS
	- COSI

## Model features

	decay or not
	depletion or not
	separation demand or one line
	fifo lifo

## Hypothesis

Hypothesis of scenario define the space range for input parameter.

## Output

An output is composed by raw data calculated by the model according to input and hypothesis of the scenario.
