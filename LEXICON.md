# Scenario:

A scenario is constituted by the following set :

	- Input
	- Model
	- Output

It defines a well defined trajectory for a nuclear fleet evolution on a given time frame.

# Input:

Self consistant set of parameters that allows the complete description of the simulation, including:

	- a time frame
	- all the cycle units (different facilities and potential connections)
	- each facilities parameters (might be some overlap) and modeling options
	- their evolutions along the time frame considered.

# Model:

Represents the computationnal tool that processes the input and performing output calculation according to defined hypothesis. Here's a non exhaustive list of models : 

	- CYCLUS
	- CLASS


# Output:

# Hypothesis:

# Modelisation Parameter:

# Metric:
  Understandable values

# Input Parameter:
  all facilities parameters: BU, Cooling time, tails asset, Power, cycle time,
  Capacity factor,...
