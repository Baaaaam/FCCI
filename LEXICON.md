Scenario:

Input (var + cycle description) + Model + output


Input:
Self consistant set of parameters that allows the complete description of the
simulation, including:
 - a time frame
 - all the cycle: different facilities and
  potential connections
 - each facilities parameters (might be some overlap) and
  modeling options
 - their evolutions along the time frame considered.

Model:

Output:

Hypothesis:

Modelisation Parameter:

Metric:
  Understandable values

input Parameter:
  all facilities parameters: BU, Cooling time, tails asset, Power, cycle time,
  Capacity factor,...
